# Timeseries

## Definition
Sequence of indexed data points (called observations for a real-world phenomena or realizations for an underlying stochastic process or dynamical system) ordered by an increasing (discrete) time-label. As opposed to spatial analysis, in timeseries there will usually be present some form of correlation of current observations with past ones. 

As such a stochastic process modelling such timeseries will usually reflect the dependency of data points that are temporally separated by short gaps.

## Intuition
Timeseries can be generated by a deterministic discrete or continuous-time dynamical system by simply recording the state of the system at specific sampled times. Even though the timeseries may look noisy at first this does not mean that the underlying system producing the series is stochastic. Chaotic, yet deterministic dynamical systems will in fact produce noise-like timeseries. 

To characterise a timeseries one can use a subset of its realizations to estimate various statistical indicators such as:
- mean;
- variance;
- skewness;
- (auto)covariance;
- (auto)correlation;
- spectrum
