# Equilibrium
In a [continuous-time dynamical system](ContinuousTimeSystem.md) it is a point $x^{ * }$ in phase space s.t. $x^{'}=f(x^{ *  })=0$.

Equilibria are points in which the dynamics prescribes a steady-state, meaning that the state evolution is stationary.

They are found at the intersections of distinct [nullclines](Nullcline.md).

They are the first object found in the analysis of dynamical systems. The linearisation of the system in a small neighbourgh of each equilibria allows to find the [manifolds](Manifold.md) of the system.

* [__Stability__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory): by analising the eigenvalues of the Jacobian evaluated at the equilibrium $D_{f}(x=x^{ * })$ you can determine the stability of such point: 
  > $x^{ * }$ is a _stable equilibria/attractor/sink_ if all the eigenvalues have (strictly) negative real parts;

  > $x^{ * }$ is an _unstable equilibria/repeller/source_ if all the eigenvalues have (strictly) positive real parts;

  > $x^{ * }$ is a _saddle_ if of all the eigenvalues (which have non-zero real parts) at least one has a different sign than the others;

  > $x^{ * }$ is a _centre_ if it's non-hyperbolic (that is with zero real part) and it is has at least one purely immaginary eigenvalue .

* __Index__: based on index theory every equilibria has either index: 
  > $[x^{ * }]=+1$ if it's a sink, a source or a centre;

  > $[x^{ * }]=-1$ if it's a saddle.
