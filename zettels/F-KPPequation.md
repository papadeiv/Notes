# Fisher-Kolmogoroff-Petrovsky-Piscounoff equation
[WikiLink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPP%E2%80%93Fisher_equation)

It is the particular case of a [KPP equation](KPPequation.md) where the non-linear reaction term if of the form $f(u)=u(1-u)$.

* In @LXIUPQE6#Kuehn_2015 a stochastic F-KPP with additive noise is studied in the context of deriving EWS of critical transitions in travelling wavefronts solutions connecting two homogeneous [steady-states](SteadyState.md).
