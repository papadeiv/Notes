# FitzHugh-Nagumo equation
[WikiLink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model)

It is the prototypical model for the analysis of activator ( $u$ ) inhibitor ( $v$ ) dynamics in which $u$ produces the growth of both $u$ and $v$ while $v$ inhibits their growth.

Ths spatially-homogeneous model (i.e. without diffusion) was introduced by Richard FitzHugh in @CC472PWK#Fitzhugh_1961 as the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol (BVP) model for the analysis of nerve membranes. 

It is a model that features the arise of spatial patterns as a result of a homogeneous ground state losing stability undergoing either a [Hopf](HopfBifurcation.md) or a [Turing](TuringBifurcation.md) bifurcation.
When the former happens the new steady-state is homogeneous and globally oscillating with the dominantwave number being $k=0$; on the other hand when the latter occurs then the new steady-state will be a globally-patterned heterogeneous state with a dominant, finite wave number. 

* In @5VG4YEMJ#Zheng_Etal_2017 [Turing instabilities](TuringBifurcation.md) are investigated for th stochastic FHN.
* In @LHMXPJP3#Chu_2020 a First Integral Method (FIM) is used to derive exact solutions of the $1-$ dimensional, single specie FHN equation of the form $f(u)=u(1-u)(u-\xi)$.
