## Seeds preparation
- Collect the seeds directly from a pepper.
- Wash and place them on a paper towel sheet and let them dry for a day.

## Sowing/Semina
- Best time of the year in the North Island is during late to winter to early summer, August to November.
- Sow in seed starting trays in about half 5~10 mm depth of a traditional potting mix.
- DO NOT position under direct sunlight however they do require lots of illumination; a well lit indoor (if the weather is still not warm enough) or outdoor (if the weather is warm) spot (next to a window) does the trick.
- Water regurarly to keep the soil moist but not wet; once a day to once every two days depending on the weather but generally water every time the top of the soil is dry. 

## Germination/Germogliazione
- Expect it in 10 to 20 days.
- Keep watering daily or once every two days depending on the soil. 

## Repotting/Travaso
- Once the seedlings have at least two sets of true leaves and are 5~7 cm tall.
- Transplant in large pots (> 500 mm in diameter and 25 cm in depth) in traditional potting mix.
- Capsicum are sensitive to calcium deficiency so add lime at planting.
- Do not damage any root in the transplant; firm the soil in the new pot gently.
- Position the pot in a spot under direct sunlight for 6 hours a day.

## Growing/Coltivazione
- Water deeply less often (every second day) but take care to not get the leaves wet. 
- To avoid sunburn place a thin shader if the pots are exposed to sunlight for more than 6 hours.
- When flowering begins side dress with tomato food.
- When fruiting begins feed seaweed solution once every forthnight to improve plant health and vigour.
- Stake and ties are needed to support the stem.

## Harvest/Raccolta
- All fruits start off green then they turn red and yellow.
- Ready to harvest in 75~90 days after planting.
- Cut the fruit with sharp secateurs to avoid damaging the plant. Picking regularly encourages the plant to produce more fruit.
- Capsicums are perennials in frost-free areas. They will die in winter but produce new growth in spring.
- To save new seeds leave a fruit to go wrinkly and then scrape the seeds out.
