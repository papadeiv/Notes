# Allen-Cahn equation
[WikiLink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%E2%80%93Cahn_equation)

It is a prototypical example of a semi-linear, parabolic PDE, or [reaction-diffusion equation](ReactionDiffusionSystem.md).

It was introduced in @FPF5TLWL#Allen_Cahn_1979 for modelling phase separation processes.

For the choice of the potential $\Phi(u):=\frac{1}{4}(u^2 -1)^2$ $\Rightarrow$ $\phi(u)=u^3-u=u(u^2-1)=-u(1-u^2)$ the equation has the same normal form of the cubic [NWS](NWSequation.md) equation (i.e. with $p=2$).
