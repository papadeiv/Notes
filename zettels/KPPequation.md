# Kolmogoroff-Petrovsky-Piscounoff equation

It is the prototypical model of a [reaction-diffusion](ReactionDiffusionSystem.md) equation in $1-$ spatial dimension. 
It takes the names of the $3$ authours in @5VHCIINY#Kolmogoroff_Petrovsky_Piscounoff_1988 that first discussed the growth of biological species as a result of a non-linear reacting term $f(u)$ coupled with differential diffusion over the domain.

* In @8U9776XG#Ma_Fuchssteiner_1996 explicit travelling wave solutions are found for the case of cubic non-linearity $f(u) = -(\mu u + \ni u^2 + \delta u^3)$. 
* In @LHMXPJP3#Chu_2020 a First Integral Method (FIM) is used to derive exact solutions of the same cubic term above. 
* Following the above, in @7B7CMYYG#Zhang_2023 the same cubic term (referred to as the generalised KPP equation) is further analysed from a dynamical system perspective.
