# CONCEPT
Codim-2 bifurcation in continuous-time dynamical systems parametrised by mu and rho where the quadratic coefficient of the saddle-node bifurcation vanishes. 
The normal form is $$x^{'}=\pm x^3 +\mu x + \rho$$. 

## Intuition
To study the system you need to fix one parameter first (e.g. set mu<0 or mu>0) and then track the bifurcations that occur as a function of the other parameter.
To locate the equilibria you find the extrema of the cubic by setting the first derivative of the dynamics to zero; you will obtain a function x(mu,rho) which you can then plug back into the vector field to find out the conditions on the parameters mu and rho such that the dynamics is zero.
The saddle-node bifurcations occur at rho = pm (2/3)* mu * sqrt(mu/3).
