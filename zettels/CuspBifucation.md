# Cusp bifurcation 
Codim-2 bifurcation in [continuous-time dynamical systems](ContinuousDynamicalSystems.md) parametrised by mu and rho where the quadratic coefficient of the [saddle-node bifurcation](SaddleNodeBifurcation.md) vanishes. 
The normal form is $x^{'}=f(x;\mu,\rho)=\pm x^3 +\mu x + \rho$. 

## Intuition
To study the system you need to fix one parameter first (e.g. set $\mu<0$ or $\mu>0$) and then track the bifurcations that occur as a function of the other parameter.
To locate the [equilibria](Equilibrium.md) you find the extrema of the cubic by setting the first derivative of the dynamics to zero i.e. $f^{'}=\pm3x^2 + \mu=0$; you will obtain a function $x(\mu,\rho)$ which you can then plug back into the vector field $f(x(\mu,\rho);\mu,\rho)$ to find out the conditions on the parameters $\mu$ and $\rho$ such that the dynamics is zero.
