Named after the authours in @P8TSSBHC#Swift_Hohenberg_1977 that first introduced the model for instabilities in thermal convection.

* In @HV6EKPF7#Burke_Knobloch_2007 the stability of localised states of the $1-$ dimensional SH equation with a cubic-quintic non-linearities i.e. $N(u)=2u^3 - u^5$.
* In @4NQG8FSS#Hutt_2007 the cubic non-linearity $N(u)=-u^3$ is investigated.
* In @YRXASVUC#SánchezPérezMoreno_RuizChavarría_RuizChavarría_2014 the quadratic-cubic form $N(u)=gu^2-u^3$ is investigated numerically.
* In @YDDNKMPB#Doelman_Etal_2003 a modified cubic SH with the additional term $-\beta |\nabla u|^2$ is investigated and the bifurcation diagram is drawn.
* In @S854MAGM#Medvedev_Pelinovsky_2023 Turing bifurcations of the cubic non-linearity are analysed.
