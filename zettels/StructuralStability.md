# Structural stability

In [stability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory) for [continuous-time dynamical systems](ContinuousTimeSystem.md) it describes the property of a vector field to be robust, in its qualitative long-term behaviour, to small perturbations.

One definition is that $f(x)$ is structurally stable if it is topologically equivalent to $f(x)+\varepsilon g(x)$ for an arbitrary small $\varepsilon\gtrapprox0$.
