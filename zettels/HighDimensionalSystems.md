# High-dimensional dynamical systems

It is the generalization of [continuous-time dynamical systems](ContinuousDynamicalSystems.md) to infinite dimensional variables, i.e. instead of a finite dimensional vector variable, whose temporal evolution is described through a set of ordinary differential equations

$
\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}=f(\boldsymbol{x};\boldsymbol{\mu}),\quad\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n
$

these systems describe the time dynamics of scalar and vector fields defined over a spatial domain

$
\partial_t \boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{f}(\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{u}),\boldsymbol{u}) + \boldsymbol{g}(\boldsymbol{u})
$

where $\mathcal{L}$ represents a (differential) spatial linear operator while $\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{u}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{u}}$ are (in general) non-linear functions of the unknown.
