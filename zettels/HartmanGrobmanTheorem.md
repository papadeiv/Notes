# Hartman-Grobman theorem

[Simply stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem#Main_theorem) it provides the necessary conditions for a vector field $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\mu})$ of a [continuous-time system](ContinuousTimeSystem.md) to be topologically equivalent to its linearisation $D_{\boldsymbol{f}}(\boldsymbol{x})$ in a small neighbour of its [equilibria](Equilibrium.md) $\boldsymbol{x}_0$.

For equilibria that do not coincide with the origin the theorem allows for the existence of a [homeomorphism](Homeomorphism.md) between the current coordinate systems to a new one in which the [normal forms](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109164316/http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/sdenf.php) are valid (i.e. the equilibria is at the origin).
