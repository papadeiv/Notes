# Turing bifurcation
[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern#cite_note-7)

In @3HCHXAKR#Turing_1997 Alan Turing first proposed the concept of spatially heterogeneous patterns arising autonomously from homogeneous steady-states.

These transitions have since been labels Turing bifurcations in which the homogeneous steady-state loses stability in favour of a spatial pattern one at finite wave number $k$.

* In @3LABT3G9#Benson_Maini_Sherratt_1998 the structure of such bifurcation is analysed for small diffusion coefficient variation.
* In @8JP4B5HX#Woolley_2022 it is proved that BCs have a huge impact in the sensitivity analysis of Turing bifurcations.
