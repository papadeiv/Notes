# Continuous dynamical system
In the most general setting it is a $(n+1)$ -dimensional vector field $f(x,t)$ that describes the pointwise in space and instantaneous dynamics of $n$ -dimensional state variables in phase space.

* __Time-dependence__: depending on the time-dependence of the vector field the system (and underlying ODE) can either be:
  > _autonomous_: meaning that the vector field does not change with time i.e. $f(x,t)=f(x)$;

  > _non-autonomous_: meaning that the vector field does change with time. A $m$ -dimensional non-autonomous dynamical system $f(x,t)$ can always be recasted in a $(m+1)$ -dimensional autonomous version $g(x)$ by specifying the rate of change of the time dimension as an additional state variable $t^{'}=\epsilon$.
