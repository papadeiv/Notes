# Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation

Introduced in 1969 indipendently by [Newell-Whitehead](https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/finite-bandwidth-finite-amplitude-convection/643FA34BBB46A17EA21B75A6AB40A4B7) and [Segel](https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/distant-sidewalls-cause-slow-amplitude-modulation-of-cellular-convection/BC4A6D47EFEA71241E52870BC6039EEE) it is a generalisation of a [Fisher-KPP](F-KPPequation.md)-type equation to a $p-th$ order polynomial non-linearity of the form $f(u) = u(1-u^p)$ where $p\geq2$.

It is a prototypical model for the study of [Turing patterns](TuringBifurcation.md) and instabilities and it has beenused in particular to describe [Rayleigh-Benard convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93B%C3%A9nard_convection) instability of standing waves solutions.

The cubic case $f(u)=u-u^3=u(1-u^2)$ is reminiscent of a (supercritical) [pitchfork](PitchforkBifurcation.md) normal form with an unstable ground-state $u(x)=0$ coexisting with two more (non-trivial) homogeneous steady states $u(x)=\pm1$.

* In @6PJ97YBZ#Zemskov_2014 the $2-$ dimensional NWS equation is shown to arise naturally after the non-linear analysis of striped pattern solutions.
* * In @LHMXPJP3#Chu_2020 a First Integral Method (FIM) is used to derive exact solutions of NWS of the form $f(u)=u(1-u^2)$.
* In @PBJINHS2#Iqbal_Etal_2023 numerical solutions of the stochastic NWS are found.
* In @KH66J5IT#Hashemi_Mirzazadeh_2023 exact solutions of the stochastic NWS are found.
